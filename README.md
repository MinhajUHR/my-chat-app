# my-chat-app
A real-time chat application using Socket.IO, Node.js, and Express, designed for seamless communication with modern web technologies.

The "Chat-APP" project began with the goal of creating a real-time chat application that offers seamless communication using modern web technologies. The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface.

For the backend, I used Node.js with Express to handle server-side operations, ensuring efficient processing of requests and smooth data flow. Socket.IO was integrated for real-time communication, enabling instant message delivery and updating across all connected clients.

Throughout the development process, I focused on implementing key features like user authentication, private and group chat rooms, media sharing, and online/offline status indication. I hosted the application using Socket.IO to ensure stable and scalable deployment.

This project has been an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of web development and real-time communication technologies.
